            <p>Task Tracker is my first app made with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>
            <p>The backend (authentication, storage, notifcations, etc.)  is handled with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>.</p>
            <p>Here is a link to the project on <a href="https://github.com/eckhoff98/TaskTracker">Github</a>.</p>
            <p>
                The styling is mainly handled with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> with a little bit of custom CSS here and there.
